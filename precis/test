I want to express keen interest in joining esteemed computer science program of your university as a postgraduate student. I have completed four years’ undergraduate course in Computer Science and Engineering at one of the most reputed colleges of India, ISM Dhanbad, and worked for two and half years in two reputed technology companies - Yahoo Inc. and Flipkart. After excelling in academic courses and applying those concepts in real life as a professional, I gained knowledge in multiple fields of computer science. However, during last three years, I realized the importance of focus and specialization which led me to my decision of pursuing higher studies. The postgraduate program at your university enthused me with eminent faculty and strong research capabilities. I believe a post graduate course at University of Wisconsin-Madison will take me to the next level in my career.
I have a strong interest in Mathematics right from my childhood years. Probably, I got it from my father. My father is a civil engineer with keen interest in Mathematics who instilled the same aptitude in me. I got introduced to programming in 9th standard where my curriculum included C++. I spent hours imagining various applications of the programming which raised lot questions in my mind. I did well in computer science subject and scored 99% and 98% in 10th and 12th standards respectively. These formative years inspired me to pursue a career in Computer Science.
While taking admission in engineering college, I preferred Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) stream. Based on my performance in the entrance examination, IIT JEE, I could get admission in programs other than CSE in IITs. I made CSE as my first preference and secured admission at ISM Dhanbad. In college, I got further inclined towards computer science. In the first year, I scored average grades (7.8 in first semester & 7.94 in second semester) where there were subjects outside of computer science. My academic performance improved from second year as the curriculum shifted towards computer science. I scored GPA of more than 9.0 four times in six semesters and was consistently a topper in my class.
In addition to strong academics, my interest was always in implementing academic knowledge into practical application. I did several real life projects in areas of networking during my undergraduate years on my own initiative. I learned Java, HTML and software like Photoshop, flash, Dreamweaver, etc. on my own. I developed my first website in year 2010. During second year at college, my Data Structure teacher, Dr. Chiranjeev Kumar, influenced me by his teaching style and knowledge on the subject. I approached him for a project and he introduced me to seniors who were working on a project on improving existing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks. They were facing problems during simulation and demonstrating that their protocol is better than the existing protocol. I read multiple books on the subject, sought help from our guide, professors in other college and learned Network Simulator 2. However, we were not able to complete the project so I stayed back in college during the winter vacation and did in-depth research on the subject. From this experience, I learned the importance of building from existing knowledge and work of my predecessors and experts.
I did my first summer internship at Wipro, one of the largest technology companies in India. I worked on a project of setting up local area network at IIT Roorkee, Noida Campus. I learned about networking devices like routers, switches, bridges, hubs, etc. Post this project, I undertook a project to develop “Intra Mailing System” using J2EE. During my third year, I did internship in Hewlett Packard Education Services, Noida where I worked on different kind of network topologies and simulations. Having done internship in some of the reputed companies in India, I wanted to gain international experience. I got invitation from two colleges for internship – Universiti Sains Malaysia and Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain. The offer from Malaysia was with full aid while University of Catalonia was offering no aid. I choose University of Catalonia whose project I found interesting. The project was to “Design of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle to monitor environmental accidents” under the guidance of Dr. Enric Pastors. It was about implementing a system to collect data about dangerous gases, temperature, radioactivity levels etc. with the help of unmanned aircrafts. The main application of the system is to predict high risk areas of forest fires. During the internship, I got an opportunity to interact with students from other countries, appreciate the research capabilities of a global university and further build expertise in networking. Ever since then, it was very clear in my mind that I would like to pursue higher studies in a global university.
As part of my database management project, I developed a Student Information System which could generate resumes from the data provided by students. These resumes could be used during campus placements. This system was later used by the Placement Cell of my college and eased the work for students and Placement Cell. It eliminated the requirement of sending resumes to recruiters over mail as they can access it over web. Moreover, the resumes could be edited real time by the students. I learned PHP, CSS, Javascript and Ajax on my own for the project. I received A+ grade for the project.
In the final year of my college, I did my undergraduate thesis on “Developing an enhanced clustering algorithm for Wireless Mobile Ad Hoc networks” under the guidance of Dr. Chiranjeev Kumar. I selected the topic as I was interested in Ad Hoc networks and have worked on the subject. I led a team of three. The objective of the project was to design and implement a new clustering algorithm for communication in wireless Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET). During the presentation, professors lauded my efforts and knowledge on the subject. I received A+ grade for the project. After graduating from the college, I received Gold Medal from Dr. Pranab Mukherjee, the President of India for my performance in the computer science department (batch of 2013). My parents were in
audience and were proud of me. This was one of the proudest moments in my life.
I got a job offer from Yahoo and was among the two from my college to get an offer. I joined Yahoo as part of their Geoinformatics team in July’13. This team was responsible for delivering geographical data for places to Yahoo ecosystem and external clients, for instance, Apple Weather App uses this data. I worked on the Geoinformatics Data Ingestion Pipeline. I was responsible for automating it with all the validations done on places at run time during ingestion. In Yahoo, I gain further experience in programming and managing large amount of data. I worked for 17 months in Yahoo and gained expertise in big data, distributed systems, machine learning and operating systems. However, during this time Yahoo was under pressure from shareholders and as part of their cost reduction strategy, Yahoo shut down its engineering team in Bangalore in Oct’14. I was one of the 500 employees who were asked to leave. This was the lowest point in my life. My family supported me and through their support I overcame this failure. I got four job offers within notice period of one month.
In November 2014, I joined Flipkart which is the biggest e-commerce company in India. Flipkart is ahead of giants like Amazon in Indian marketplace. I got opportunities to work on projects from ideation to final implementation. I was part of User Cluster Team in Flipkart, which work on delivering user information to any eco-system within Flipkart. It is responsible for functions such as user authentication and authorization. I worked on end to end development of Subscription Service which is made generalized enough to serve any kind of user’s subscription. Currently it supports Flipkart First (similar to Amazon Prime) and Flash Sale (period where products are offered at high discounts) related data of user. For Flash Sales, I was able to achieve the request per second of 15 times the actual real traffic on the website. This, I was able to do despite constraints on computing infrastructure. I was also responsible for design and end to end development of API Throttling Framework. I worked on leaky bucket
algorithm for streamed throttling of services using Redis as backend and nginx as a proxy, reduced the logic computation around throttling to 2ms per API call. I also worked on features related to authentication in Flipkart site.
My decision to apply for the University of Wisconsin-Madison is because of its respected faculty and research capabilities. My research interests are Computer Networking and Distributed Computing. Having gone through the profiles of faculty, web-pages of computer science program and interacting with existing students at your university, I strongly believe your university would be the best platform for me to improve my knowledge and gain research experience in computer science. I believe in addition of developing myself at University of Wisconsin-Madison, I would be able to contribute something tangible to your university. It would be a privilege for me to join post graduate program in computer science at your university.
